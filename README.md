## Project Overview

Our wireless headstage is a three-layer device comprising:
-  An Intan RHD2132 data-acquisition layer
-  An iCEstick FPGA controller layer
-  An ESP32-S3 Wi-Fi layer

Key features include:
- Compatibility with various electrophysiology probes via Omnetics connectors
- Full-speed 32-channel data recording
- Wireless connectivity for unrestrained movement
- Compact design (23.5 x 18 x 22 mm) weighing only 7.34 grams
- Programmable via micro-USB and battery-powered operation

While our current prototype demonstrates significant potential, we're continuously working on optimizing its design for even better performance and usability in neuroscience research.
